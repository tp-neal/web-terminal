# Web-Based Terminal Emulator

A front-end, interactive terminal emulator created with vanilla JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS. This project simulates a Unix-like command-line interface in the
browser, complete with a virtual file system and a suite of standard commands.

up and down arrow keys.

* **Clean UI:** A simple, responsive terminal window built with modern CSS.
